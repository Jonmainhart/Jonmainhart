# Jonathan Mainhart
## Introduction
ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Jonmainhart

I am retiring from the military to pursue a career as a Software Engineer. I am enrolled in the Software Development and Security program at the University of Maryland Global Campus and will graduate in May 2022 with my Bachelor of Science degree.
I enjoy working with Python and Java, but I am a Sailor and have been known to dip my toes into the C.
